## Course:
### This app was made during a beginner's course on Angular, a front-end web development framework. The instructor, Sunil, will teach you the basics of TypeScript and Angular, including how to create components, use data binding, and work with routing. He will also cover more advanced topics such as forms, dependency injection, and testing.

Angular is a component-based framework, which means that you build your application by creating small, reusable components.
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing. This can help to catch errors early in the development process.
Data binding is a way to connect the data in your application to the DOM (Document Object Model). This can make your code more concise and easier to maintain.
Routing is a way to navigate between different parts of your application. Angular provides a built-in routing system that makes it easy to create complex navigation structures.
Forms are a way to collect user input. Angular provides a form validation system that can help to ensure that your forms are valid.
Dependency injection is a way to decouple your components and services. This can make your code more modular and easier to test.
Testing is an important part of any software development process. Angular provides a testing framework that can help you to write unit tests and end-to-end tests.
